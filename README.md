# Samatha

A meditation app for the Samatha practice. 

## What is Samatha?

*Samatha* (Sanskrit: *śamatha* or *shamatha*) means calm or tranquility. In the Buddhist tradition it refers to a family of meditation methods that cultivate a calm, steady, and unified mind. The primary goal is the development of concentration (*samādhi*), often described as collectedness or one-pointedness of mind.

- How it works: Samatha uses a stable meditation object, commonly the breath, to gently settle attention. When attention wanders, it is brought back without strain.
- Outcomes: With consistent practice, agitation and distraction subside, leading to tranquility, joy, and deep absorption states known as *jhāna*.
- Relation to insight: In many lineages, Samatha pairs with *Vipassanā* (insight) practice. Calm and stability from Samatha support clear seeing into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not‑self.
- Everyday benefits: Greater emotional balance, reduced reactivity, and improved focus in daily life.

This app aims to support Samatha practice by providing a simple place to build steady, gentle attention—one breath at a time.
